# Ksense Assessment

A demo project for Ksense for an API integration project. Works with a simple API to pull patient data, perform calculations, and output results that are to be submitted in a specific format. 

Follows the 12 factor app approach and uses a `.env` file for secrets and parameters around the API, which is hosted by Ksense.
